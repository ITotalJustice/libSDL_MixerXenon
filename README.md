# SDL_mixer for libxenon (xbox 360 sdk)

you need libxenon installed and the enviroment variable `DEVKITXENON` set to the directory that libxenon is installed in.

to build and install, run:
```sh
make -f Makefile.xenon install
```

## Demo

to build the demo:

```sh
cd Demo/playmus
make
```

i haven't tried the demo myself (no xbox) so unsure if it works
